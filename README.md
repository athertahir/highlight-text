Usernames and Passwords
Part 3 - Using Basic Authentication with a Secured Registry in Linux
From "Part 2" we have a registry running in a Docker container, which we can securely access over HTTPS from any machine in our network. We used a self-signed certificate, which has security implications, but you could buy an SSL from a CA instead, and use that for your registry. With secure communication in place, we can set up user authentication.

The registry server and the Docker client support basic authentication over HTTPS. The server uses a file with a collection of usernames and encrypted passwords. The file uses Apache's htpasswd.

1. Create the password file with an entry for user "admin" with password "cloudusthad";

mkdir auth

docker run --entrypoint htpasswd registry:latest -Bbn admin cloudusthad > auth/htpasswd

> The options are:

* --entrypoint Overwrite the default ENTRYPOINT of the image
* -B to force bcrypt vs default md5
* -b run in batch mode
* -n display results

2. We can verify the entries have been written by checking the file contents - which shows the user names in plain text and a cipher text password:

cat auth/htpasswd

Output:

moby:$2y$05$Geu2Z4LN0QDpUJBHvP5JVOsKOLH/XPoJBqISv1D8Aeh6LVGvjWWVC
